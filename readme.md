# CodeFusion: Online HTML, CSS, and JS IDE

**CodeFusion** is an interactive online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) where users can write and execute HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. The app features a split-screen layout: one side for coding and the other for viewing live output. Users can save their code online, making it accessible anytime, and switch between dark and light themes for a personalized experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS)
  - JavaScript (React.js)
  
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js, Express.js
  
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL, Sequelize ORM

- **Authentication**:
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## 💡 Features

- **Write Code**: 
  - Users can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a real-time editor on one side of the screen.
  
- **Live Preview**: 
  - The other half of the screen displays the output of the code written on the left side. This allows users to instantly see how their code performs.

- **Dark & Light Theme**: 
  - Easily switch between dark and light themes for a better coding experience depending on user preference.

- **Save Code Online**: 
  - Users can save their code to the database and access it later from any device by logging in.
  
- **Authentication**: 
  - Login and registration system using JWT tokens for secure user authentication.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- PostgreSQL
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/codefusion.git
    cd codefusion
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    For both frontend and backend, run the following commands:
    
    **Frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

    **Backend**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure the Database**:
   - Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system.
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database for the project.
   - Configure the database connection in `backend/config/database.js` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

4. **Run the Backend**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run start
    ```

5. **Run the Frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run start
    ```

    The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🔐 Authentication

- Users can **sign up** and **log in** using their username and password. A JWT token is generated upon successful login for secure authentication.
- The token is stored in the browser’s local storage and used to make authenticated requests.
